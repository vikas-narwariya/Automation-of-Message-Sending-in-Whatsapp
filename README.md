**Automating of Message Sending in Whatsapp

The aim of this project to send a message to a person multiple time without wiritng it again and again
New Project
Here I used selenium library  to import webdrivers which is used to contact to chrome for opening the web browser on the Desktop.
And I used import time to wait for the time to open the whatsapp web browser.
Using this code you can send a single message to a  person in a range in which you have to enter how many times you have to send the message to a person.

Any thing that I did wrongly or it can be optimize, so feel free to raise Issues.
Your Suggestions will be welcomed!
